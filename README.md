Note: the project was created with scalability in mind, therefore preference was given to typescript, 
as it allows to better control code and detect issues on the early stages of the development.

- Installation: `npm i`

- Tests: `npm test`

- Linter: `npm run lint` 

- Example of usage: `example.ts`

Some explanations can be found in the code, but there's no much comments, 
as most of the code should be self-documented.
